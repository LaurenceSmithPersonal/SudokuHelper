# SudokuHelper
Program to help with solving Sudoku puzzles.

This is a program I wrote when Sudokus first appeared in the UK, in 2004.

The idea was that it helps automate some of the boring bits of solving sudokus and makes it easy to see what the possible numbers are that can go into each box.

I thought it would be a good project to revive to help me to get used to using GitHub (and to integrate with Eclipse).

Originally written in Java using NetBeans IDE.
